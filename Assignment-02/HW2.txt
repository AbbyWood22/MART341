A directory is used to refer to a filing system and or the path to find the files. For example if a directory is considered a tree then the files would be its branches. 

Git Version Control is useful because you can see the changes that have been made. This makes it helpful to share with classmates and also see your growth throughout the class. 

My favorite artistic medium before the lesson would have to be wood because I think it is peaceful to watch be made and it is also my last name. However, after the lesson I would have to say websites because it feels as though the possibilities are endless and you can make anything from an interactive art show to a fun game to both help engage your viewers and make it memorable.
